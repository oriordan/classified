Classified data scanner
=======================

Classified is a fast forensic tool that aids in scanning for sensitive data,
such as unencrypted PAN (Primary Account Number) data, passwords, network
traffic dumps, and so on. You can use this utility to assist in getting and
maintaining PCI DSS compliance.


Requirements
------------

Classified is suitable for Python 2.6 - Python 2.7. With little effort it could
be ported to Python 3.x as well.

Required:

* `Python 2.6 - 2.7 <http://python.org/>`_
* `python-magic <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-magic>`_, for mime type detection

The current reporting code will not work on Python version 2.4 or 2.5, because
we rely on `PEP 3101 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3101/>`_ compatible
string formatting.


Requirements (optional)
-----------------------

Optionally, install:

* `backports.lzma <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/backports.lzma>`_, to inspect LZMA compressed files and archives
* `rarfile <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rarfile>`_, to inspect RAR archives
